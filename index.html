              <!--style = "padding-left: 10px; text-wrap:balance"-->
              Currently on the exciting journey of pursuing a master's degree in
              computer science at Florida Atlantic University, with an
              anticipated graduation in May 2024.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
              In my current role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I play a
              pivotal role in fostering students' understanding of Python and
              data structures. Through organizing weekly office hours and
              leading hands-on lab sessions, I aim to provide valuable support
              and insights. I also take pride in occasionally stepping into the
              classroom and sharing my knowledge and passion for data structures
              with fellow students.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
              Prior to my current academic pursuit, I spent two enriching years
              as a Software Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I
              contributed to the success of a European-based client, "Proximus."
              My responsibilities included developing software solutions that
              centered around sales applications. My skill set encompasses
              Python, Siebel CRM, SQL, and front-end technologies. Notably, I
              crafted Python scripts for seamless interactions with REST APIs,
              designed order screens, and authored core validation scripting
              rules. These contributions served as vital components of order
              validations before submissions.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
              My academic journey, combined with professional experience, has
              equipped me with a robust set of skills, ranging from classroom
              instruction to hands-on software development. I am enthusiastic
              about leveraging these skills in a full-time role upon graduation.
