                            In my current role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I play a pivotal role in fostering students' understanding of Python and data structures. Through organizing weekly office hours and leading hands-on lab sessions, I aim to provide valuable support and insights. I also take pride in occasionally stepping into the classroom and sharing my knowledge and passion for data structures with fellow students.

                            Prior to my current academic pursuit, I spent two enriching years as a Software Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I contributed to the success of a European-based client, "Proximus." My responsibilities included developing software solutions that centered around sales applications. My skill set encompasses Python, Siebel CRM, SQL, and front-end technologies. Notably, I crafted Python scripts for seamless interactions with REST APIs, designed order screens, and authored core validation scripting rules. These contributions served as vital components of order validations before submissions.
